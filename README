There isn't much to it, so thses notes should suffice:

* The background changes color according to the quality of the fix.

  * Red: No fix.

  * Yellow: Two dimensional fix, i.e. altitude is invalid.

  * Green: Three dimensional fix.

* The number of satellites seen and used in fixes is shown in a
  progress bar, where the progress bar shows the ratio of the two.

* You can change how some of the data are displayed, e.g. speed in
  miles per hour, knots or kilometers per hour. You can then save
  these settings.

* Menu functions have accelerator (shortcut) keys.

* For automotive use, try a fairly large font, e.g. 17 to 25 points.


To compile, you need:

apt-get gcc make libgtk2.0-dev
