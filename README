This program is a straightforward gps monitor program using the GTK+
windowing system.

There isn't much to it, so these notes should suffice:

* The background changes color according to the quality of the fix.

  * Grey: No GPSD connection.

  * Red: No fix.

  * Yellow: Two dimensional fix, i.e. altitude is invalid.

  * Green: Three dimensional fix.

* The number of satellites seen and used in fixes is shown in a
  progress bar, where the progress bar shows the ratio of the two.

* You can change how some of the data are displayed, e.g. speed in
  miles per hour, knots or kilometers per hour, etc. You can then save
  these settings.

* Menu functions have accelerator (shortcut) keys.

* For automotive use, try a fairly large font, e.g. 17 to 25 points.

Command line options. These you may also set and save in the
GUI. These override the defaults and saved values.

-d Set the format of the latitude and longitude display:

   * d: Degrees and decimal, ddd.dddddd

   * m: Degrees and minutes, ddd mm.mmmm

   * s: Degrees, minutes, seconds, ddd mm ss.ss

-e Track/heading will be reported as magnetic

-h Print a terse help message.

-k Speed in knots

-m Metric measures

-p Port (default is 2947)

-e Track/heading will be reported as true

-u US measures

-v Verbose (print to stdout)

To compile, you should get everything you need with:

apt install gcc libgps-dev libgtk2.0-dev make

Or substitute libgtk-4-dev for GTK 4.

Otherwise, you need:

apt install gcc make libgtk2.0-dev libgps-dev

except on debian squeeze, where you may need:

apt -t squeeze-backports install gcc make libgtk2.0-dev

There is a make target "validate". This is set up to run astyle so you
can have a suitable style in your contributions (hint, hint...). You
will need astyle if you don't already have it. It will also validate
the desktop file, which requires the package desktop-file-utils.

apt install astyle desktop-file-utils
